# Tasker - the world's sleekest task managing website

<div align="center"> <h3>Description:</h3></div>
This website was created using Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Django framework. It features a stored list of tasks, their deadlines and colouration/warnings as they approach, housed in a sleek background design.<br><br><br>

Important Features:
1) Email Reminders - Emails are automatically sent from Tasker.notify if you request it to. From these auto generated emails, the user can set a reminder on their local calendar.
2) Login System - Each individual sees their own tasks as they are recorded under their name in the SQLite 3 file.
3) Django Admin - The use of Django and its own approach to relational databases allows for an admin page to edit information.
4) Colouration - Colours are used to signify importance at a glance.
5) Editability - Each task is able to be asynchronously marked as complete, edited or even deleted, offering the versatility needed for real use.
